Trancybox

A fork of Fancybox 1.3.4

Primarily used to document modifications that are
made to be used in the author's production projects.

All commits pushed are tested in IE8+ and the latest
FF and Chrome, and have been used on the author's
production sites for a couple of weeks.

No large new features will be added, only smoothing-out
work and small-scale improvements that don't break
backwards-compatibility.
